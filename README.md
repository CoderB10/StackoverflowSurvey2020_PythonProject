# 🧠 StackOverflow 2020 Developer Survey Analysis 📊

Welcome to my data analysis project based on the **2020 StackOverflow Developer Survey** — a global survey with responses from **64,000+ developers**! This project dives deep into the demographics, experiences, and preferences of developers worldwide using tools like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. 🐍📈

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset was obtained from StackOverflow's **2020 Developer Survey**, one of the largest annual surveys targeting developers globally.

* 🔢 **21 Questions** asked per respondent
* 👥 **64,000+ Respondents**
* 🌍 Covers diverse aspects such as:

  * Country of residence
  * Age (current & when they started coding)
  * Coding experience (total and professional)
  * Most used & preferred programming languages
  * Current job roles
  * Educational background

---

## 🧠 Key Insights from the Survey

### 🌐 Community & Demographics

* The survey is **somewhat representative** of the global programming community.
* ⚠️ However, there's a noticeable **underrepresentation** of:

  * Programmers from **non-English speaking countries**
  * **Women** and **non-binary** individuals

### 💡 Diversity & Inclusion

* The programming community is **not as diverse** as it can be.
* Improvements are visible, but:

  * We should **support underrepresented groups** more proactively — be it by **age, gender, race, or geography**.

### 🎓 Education & Career Path

* Most developers have a **college degree**, though:

  * A large number did **not major in Computer Science**.
* ✅ A **CS degree isn't mandatory** to become a developer!
* Many work as **freelancers** or **part-timers**, which can be a **great entry point** into tech careers.

### 💻 Programming Languages

* **Most used in 2020**:

  * 🥇 JavaScript
  * 🥈 HTML/CSS
  * 🥉 SQL & Python
* **Most loved**:

  * 🧡 Rust
  * 💙 TypeScript
  * 💚 Python (close third, despite already being mainstream)
* **Most wanted/favoured**:

  * Python leads, possibly due to its **ease of learning** and **cross-domain applications**.

### ⏱️ Work Habits

* Developers typically work **\~40 hours per week**, with some **regional variation**.

### 👶👴 Age & Coding

* People from a **wide range of age groups** code.
* It's never too late (or too early!) to start coding — even as a hobby.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

* `Python`
* `Pandas`
* `NumPy`
* `Matplotlib`
* `Seaborn`

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This analysis paints a broad picture of the global coding community as of 2020. While we celebrate the growth and enthusiasm in the field, there's a **clear call to action** for making programming **more accessible and inclusive** for all.
